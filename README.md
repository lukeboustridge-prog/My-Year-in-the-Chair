# My Year in the Chair â€” Fresh Start

This repository has been reset to a clean Next.js 14 starter so you can rebuild the project from scratch.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
3. Build for production when you're ready:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm start
   ```

Feel free to customize the starter content in `app/page.tsx` and add any additional tooling you need.
